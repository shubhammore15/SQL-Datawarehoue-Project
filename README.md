# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

## 🚀 Overview
I developed a modern data warehousing and analytics solution using **SQL Server**, implementing the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) to transform raw data into **actionable insights**. This project demonstrates my expertise in **data engineering, ETL development, data modeling, and analytics reporting**.

## 🏗 Key Components

- **🔹 Data Architecture**: Designed a **Medallion Architecture** framework:
  - **Bronze Layer**: Ingested raw data from **CSV files** (ERP & CRM sources) into SQL Server.
  - **Silver Layer**: Performed **data cleansing, standardization, and transformation**.
  - **Gold Layer**: Modeled **business-ready data** into a **star schema** for efficient analytics.

- **🔹 ETL Pipelines**: Developed **SQL-based ETL processes** to extract, transform, and load data.
- **🔹 Data Modeling**: Designed **fact and dimension tables** optimized for analytical queries.
- **🔹 Analytics & Reporting**: Generated **SQL-driven reports and dashboards** to analyze:
  - 📌 **Customer Behavior**
  - 📌 **Product Performance**
  - 📌 **Sales Trends**

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
